// Set the correct password
var password = "123456";

// Ask for user input
var user_name = prompt("Enter your username:");
var user_password = prompt("Enter your password:");

// Check if the entered password matches the correct one
if (user_password === password) {
  alert(`Welcome ${user_name}`);
} else {
  alert("Maybe Username or Password is Invalid or Does not Match");
}

How it works:

prompt() asks the user to input their username and password.

The password is compared using a conditional if.

If it matches, a welcome message is shown with alert().

If it doesn't match, an error alert is shown.


Let me know if you want to include a fixed username too, or allow multiple users!
